# SeuratJS

**A Raphaël plugin for creating beautiful pointillized animations.**

##Pointillize and Pixelize all on the Client Side

SeuratJS is a JavaScript library that extends Raphaël and allows for the creation of vivid animations and pixelated artwork using minimal code. It does this by extacting color data from an image of your choice and rebuilding the original with filled graphical primitives in SVG. Seurat makes it extremely easy to alter what primitives are generated (how they look and where they appear) and how they animate.

SeuratJS uses the HTML5 canvas to parse color data and, because of this, the library operates **entirely on the client side**.

## Take it for a Spin

Now that you’ve seen how easy it is to use SeuratJS, grab a copy off the source, a copy of RaphaelJS (http://raphaeljs.com/), and create some stunning work of your own.  The examples above are a great starting point and demonstrate using all of the settings.  However, for a more complete reference, the various settings are enumerated below.

**imageSource** - A path to the image you are going to pointalize. This is the only **REQUIRED** setting.

**step** - A number determining the pixels between color samples in the image. Used for both the x and y directions. By default 10. 

**shape** - A string indicating which built in primitive generator to use. Either 'circ' or 'rect'. By default 'circ'. 

**attributes** - An associative array describing the attibutes each primitive will have to start. By default {stroke: "none"}. 

**animator(element,x,y,step)** - A function to provide each primitive with an animation. **element** is a generated primitive with the color sample from (**x**,**y**). **step** is as described above. 

**generator(paper,x,y,color,step,attributes)** - A function to create an element object corresponding to sample (**x**,**y**) from the image. **paper** is the Raphael object we are drawing to. **step** and **attributes** are as described above. **Must return Raphaël element object.**

## Compatibility and Performance

SeuratJS' performance is largely tied to your browser's ability to handle SVG. SeuratJS runs extremely well in IE9 and Chrome. Surprisingly, Firefox can be slightly choppy with a large number of elements.

Long story short, the fewer things moving at one time, the smoother your animation is going to be. If you run into a situation where performance is unsatisfactory, either increase the step size when calling seurat() or increase your animation delays if performance isn't to your liking.
